# X-Team 88 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Communicate and divide taks evenly. On large concepts we have agreed to come together and work as a team in person at least once a week. 


## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
To track the progress, the team leader(Colin Mowbray) will hold the other members accountable and track the progress of the tasks. He do this through regular checkins throughout the week ensuring everyone is performing as scheduled.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will communicate in the groupchat on our difficulties and we will set up times to meet if the difficulties cannot be worked through.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
The team leader(Colin Mowbray) and other members will frequently check in on the other members to make sure that they are completing their tasks on time and their work is sufficient.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Please be kind and respectful. If you fall behind, please communicate to other members for help.
